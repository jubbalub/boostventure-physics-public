## BoostVenture Physics 1.0
- Added custom physics to White Space and Boss stages. They are mostly identical to stage physics, with a few differences:
-- Boost speed is reduced from 60 to 50 in White Space
-- Boost speed is reduced from 60 to 45 in Boss stages
-- Wings and Surf are unchanged in White Space and Boss stages
- Added more airtime to jump when holding down the button
- Turning in midair at low speeds is tighter
- Even more ground turning adjustments
- Added custom object layouts for 5 stages to address some weird rail booster behavior. This feature is incompatible with stage mods, so it can be disabled in the config menu.
-- Space Colony ARK Act 1
-- Rail Canyon Act 1 Challenge 1
-- Rail Canyon Act 1 Hard Challenge
-- Sunset Heights Act 1
-- Radical Highway Act 2
